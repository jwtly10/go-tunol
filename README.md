# go-tunol

A lightweight, developer-friendly tunneling service written in Go. Similarly to Ngrok, easily expose your local services to the internet securely.

Built as a way to debug and test full stack applications on mobile devices, using existing docker-compose config as configuration. 


## Overview

go-tunol allows you to create secure tunnels to your localhost, making it easy to:
- Demo and share web applications
- Debug and test applications on mobile devices
- Test webhooks locally
- Share your local development environment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/jwtly10/go-tunol@latest

# Start a tunnel to your local service
